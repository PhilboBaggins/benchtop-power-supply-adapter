Notes
-----

You should really only use one USB connector at a time... probably best to only load one or the other.

This board was designed to fit on my benchtop power supply but other power supplies may have:

* Different space between positive/negative terminals - 
* The positive/negative terminals on opposite sides - You could try flipping the board over and mounting the banana plugs on the other side. Don't flip the USB connectors though. That should work but a) hasn't been tested and b) leaves you using the side of the board with a less helpful silkscreen... easy to fix if you're changing the board though.
